# GitHubUserDetails

# Architecture: MVC
GitHub Api that is used in this project is a public api i used that has parameters for the author's name and commit {/sha} to fetch the appropriate JSON response.
URL: https://api.github.com/repos/devxoul/SwiftUITodo/commits?=0daf48fb579eae79a57018ea87d48c4361594f87
But you can also use my personal github api for my repo: https://api.github.com/repos/PRK523/GitHubApi/commits?=4e7ba64e1b12a86144e7352ae99c2fa97368f03e
Have added appropriate unit tests for testing the business logic of my code, as i personally follow this protocol while i'm working on any project.
Use of URLSession to download data from the URL's endpoints. Use of Codable protocol in Swift to encode and decode data formats, such as JSON, to native Swift objects.
